                            As Scrum Master, I was responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted.<br /> Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.<br /> The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team.<br /> The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which arenâ€™t.<br /> The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.
